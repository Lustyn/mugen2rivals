# mugen2rivals
This script converts the spritesheet and hitbox data of a Mugen character into the equivalent Rivals of Aether character files. It is currently incomplete, and the RoA hitboxes it creates are usually offset from their intended position for unknown reasons.

## How to use
Run mugenrivals.exe and enter the path to the character folder when asked. A new folder containing the converted files should appear at the same location.
  
To run the source, use python3 and install [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) through Pip.
